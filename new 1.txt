My GitHub account was already created before I did this but I never used it

I created a repository so that I can put future classwork and other things inside

I downloaded Github Desktop, then I pressed on clone repository, then I had to find out where the folder was just in case and finally I edited the readme file inside and I'm typing in Notepad++ now.
